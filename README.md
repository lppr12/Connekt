The Connekt Application is a Java-based project designed to facilitate concurrent file transfers among multiple users. Using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, the application allows clients to connect to a server, select files for transfer, and utilize features like pause and resume during downloads. 
The server employs a thread pool to efficiently manage multiple client requests simultaneously. The GUI for the client includes options for choosing files, initiating transfers, and controlling the download process. 
The project emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and user-friendly interactions, providing a foundation for further development and customization. This application showcases fundamental principles of network programming, threading, and GUI development in Java.
